Similar to [Arrays](Arrays.md) in that they are also a ordered list

Linked list have a pointer in them to the next element this means they don't need to be next to each other in memory. This makes reading the list slower but inserting/deleting faster. 

In order to find an element we MUST go through the list sequentially.
