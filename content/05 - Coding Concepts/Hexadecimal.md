\#coding 

Hexadecimal is a number system with base-16 similar to how we normally use a base-10 numbering system (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)  
Hexadecimal numbers are (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F)   
A = 10  
B = 11  
C = 12  
D = 13  
E = 14  
F = 15

By convention a hexadecimal number is prefixed with 0x 

10 in different numbering systems  
[Decimal](Decimal.md) = 10  
[Binary](Binary.md) = 0b1010  
*octal* = 0o12  
hexadecimal = 0xA (or 0xa)  
You need to be careful with hexadecimal because while 0x10 looks like the number 10 in base-10 it is actually the number 16
