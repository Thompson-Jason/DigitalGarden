title: Why do computers use binary
---

The [Binary](Binary.md) system has been in widespread use for a comparatively short period of time. Its use has been accelerated by the development of electronics and computers. The evolution of electronics and electronic components resulted in a system that detected states of a component as being ON (that is, under a significant potential difference or voltage) or OFF (that is, no or low potential difference)

These ON and OFF states were conveniently interpreted as 1 and 0, completely representing the binary number set and making it the method of choice for performing arithmetic calculations. *Logical operations*, such as NOT, AND, OR, and XOR were easily supported by the development of electronic gates resulting in the binary system being wholeheartedly adopted as conditional processing became easy
