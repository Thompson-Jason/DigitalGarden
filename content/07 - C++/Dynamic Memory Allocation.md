title: Dynamic Memory Allocation
---

\#coding #cpp 

In C++ there is no garbage collector like there is in Java memory management needs to be taken care of manually this includes allocating memory and freeing memory. 

You can use the [new keyword](new%20keyword.md) to allocate more memory and the [delete keyword](delete%20keyword.md) to free up some memory these are similar to *malloc* and *free* although there are a few differences biggest of which being type safety
