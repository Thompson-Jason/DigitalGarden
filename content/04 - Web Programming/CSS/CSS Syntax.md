# Comments

This is how you add comments into CSS code

````css
/* This is a comment */
````

Use this to comment out small sections or whole \[\[CSS Terminology#**Declaration Block**\|Declaration Block\]\]

# Whitespace

Whitespace is used in different ways someways are required and others aren't. 

## Required syntax for certain uses (such as separating CSS values)

````css
padding:10px 5px;
````

Without the space between the pixel values here there would be an error and the styles wouldn't get applied. This could cause a headache trying to find where the issue is. 

## Not required but encouraged syntax is for readability

````css nowrap
body{background:lightblue;font-size:12px;} h1{padding:10px 5px;}
````

while this will work it is definitely harder to read
