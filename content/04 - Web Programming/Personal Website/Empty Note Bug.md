# Overview

Found a bug in [obsidian-export](../../08%20-%20Tech%20I%20Use/Obsidian/obsidian-export.md) where empty notes get render as an emphasis tag. This is an issue and is currently affecting my digital garden. I have report the bug [here](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export/issues/267) on the GitHub project. I do plan on trying to fix this bug after I am finished implementing the feature I am currently working on [Remove Obsidian Comments](../../01%20-%20Projects/obsidian-export-fork.md#remove-obsidian-comments).
