React is a JS library for implementing UIs

With React it is very common to build out [Single Page Applications](../Single%20Page%20Applications.md)

In react we use something called [Components](Components.md) which is what makes up the visual aspect of our pages they are reusable and small pieces 

Something that needs to be understood well is the [Component Life Cycle](Component%20Life%20Cycle.md) This is a must know for new devs 

When rendering out a dynamically rendered list every item needs to contain the "key" prop
