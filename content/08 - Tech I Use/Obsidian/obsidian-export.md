# Overview

obsidian-export is an open-source utility written in rust that exports an obsidian vault to regular Markdown.

# My workflow

I use obsidian-export to export the files to a *quartz* instance and deploy my notes from there. I have a WIP fork of obsidian-export [obsidian-export-fork](../../01%20-%20Projects/obsidian-export-fork.md) where I will implement rendering of some of the plugins that I use for Obsidian that don't render correctly to my quartz instance.
